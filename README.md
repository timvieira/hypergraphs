This is a reference implementation of various hypergraph algorithms with an
emphasis on clarity and generality over performance.

I have decided to release it in a somewhat rough state.  I am happy to expand it
in a number of ways if there is a demand for it.  If you have any questions
about this code, please let me know.

However, even in its current state, I believe that there is a lot of useful
stuff worked out and implemented.  Most notable are the advanced dynamic
programming algorithms presented in

> Li & Einser (2009) [First- and Second-Order Expectation Semirings with Applications to Minimum-Risk Training on Translation Forests](https://cs.jhu.edu/~jason/papers/li+eisner.emnlp09.pdf)

and
